"
other,"Modified LLDB expressions to not have to JIT and run code just to see variable
values or persistent expression variables. Now if an expression consists of
a value that is a child of a variable, or of a persistent variable only, we
will create a value object for it and make a ValueObjectConstResult from it to
freeze the value (for program variables only, not persistent variables) and
avoid running JITed code. For everything else we still parse up and JIT code
and run it in the inferior. 

There was also a lot of clean up in the expression code. I made the 
ClangExpressionVariables be stored in collections of shared pointers instead
of in collections of objects. This will help stop a lot of copy constructors on
these large objects and also cleans up the code considerably. The persistent
clang expression variables were moved over to the Target to ensure they persist
across process executions.

Added the ability for lldb_private::Target objects to evaluate expressions.
We want to evaluate expressions at the target level in case we aren't running
yet, or we have just completed running. We still want to be able to access the
persistent expression variables between runs, and also evaluate constant 
expressions. 

Added extra logging to the dynamic loader plug-in for MacOSX. ModuleList objects
can now dump their contents with the UUID, arch and full paths being logged with
appropriate prefix values.

Thread hardened the Communication class a bit by making the connection auto_ptr
member into a shared pointer member and then making a local copy of the shared
pointer in each method that uses it to make sure another thread can't nuke the
connection object while it is being used by another thread.

Added a new file to the lldb/test/load_unload test that causes the test a.out file
to link to the libd.dylib file all the time. This will allow us to test using
the DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH environment variable after moving libd.dylib somewhere else.

other,"Random Number Generator (llvm)

Summary:
Provides an abstraction for a random number generator (RNG) that produces a stream of pseudo-random numbers.
The current implementation uses C++11 facilities and is therefore not cryptographically secure.

The RNG is salted with the text of the current command line invocation.
In addition, a user may specify a seed (reproducible builds).

In clang, the seed can be set via
  -frandom-seed=X
In the back end, the seed can be set via
  -rng-seed=X

This is the llvm part of the patch.

Thus, the training set always contains 10000 of the best reads available.  After training is complete, the class can be interrogated to return the SQ tag for a given RawRead object.

other,"Also store the new webserver script-package which provides now access to OpenDocument spreadsheets as well in the svn till I've access to my main devel-system again.

btw, the copycenter and the webserver script-packages are now more mature ""examples"" of some of the use-case examples for the 
OpenDocument Developers Kit as described by Rob Weir on http://opendocument.xml.org/node/154 .

I see an illustration of following points of the 20 use-cases;
1. heavy-weight client-application
2. light-weight web-based application
4. automatic creation in response to a database query (report generation)
9. read-only display of document on machine without the full editor (viewer)
10.conversion of document from one editable format to another
15.Export of data from a non-office application into an office format
16.Application which takes an existing document and outputs a modified version of that presentation
20.Software which packs/unpacks a document into relational database form

"
other,"Make mapLocalToContainer() work properly for content that follows a column spanner.

mapLocalToContainer() uses offsetFromContainer(), which uses columnOffset()
(which calls flowThreadTranslationAtOffset()), which didn't always return the
correct translation relatively to the flow thread.

This also improves the fix for bug 479155.
MultiColumnFragmentainerGroup::flowThreadTranslationAtOffset() needs to return
a translation relative to the flow thread, and the code we had basically just
happened to work by accident (flipping a flow thread portion rectangle for
writing mode around a column set is just bogus, since a column set isn't
sized in the flow thread coordinate space). This solution would cause problems
with the upcoming fix for bug 499706, because then the last column may be
shorter than the others (because it's not completely filled).

"
other,"Merging the http_requests branch into trunk

See issue #49 - Service can now have the way it makes HTTP requests plugged in.
The only requirement is that the plugin implement the new
Apache_Solr_HttpTransport_Interface. There are initial implementations for using
file_get_contents (what was used previously) and for using the curl module. Much
thanks to Timo Schmidt for submitting an initial  patch.

If the user does not specifically provide a transport interface instance, the
file get contents implementation will be used by default.

There is a compatibility breaking change on the Apache_Solr_Response
constructor. The Signature has changed.

The getDefaultTimeout and setDefaultTimeout methods on the Apache_Solr_Service
class are now deprecated. They simple pass through to the active transport's
methods of the same name, and I'd rather the user manage it there.

Additionally, I have cleaned up and expanded the existing unit tests - had to
change tests related to the breaking change, and added new ones for the new
classes as well as expanding existing ones. They should now all pass. curl tests
should only run if the curl module is enabled. file get contents tests should
only run if allow_url_fopen is enabled. transport tests do rely on an internet
connection at this time.

"
other,"ext4: make fsync to sync parent dir in no-journal for real this time

commit e12fb97222fc41e8442896934f76d39ef99b590a upstream.

Previously commit 14ece1028b3ed53ffec1b1213ffc6acaf79ad77c added a
support for for syncing parent directory of newly created inodes to
make sure that the inode is not lost after a power failure in
no-journal mode.

However this does not work in majority of cases, namely:
 - if the directory has inline data
 - if the directory is already indexed
 - if the directory already has at least one block and:
	- the new entry fits into it
	- or we've successfully converted it to indexed

So in those cases we might lose the inode entirely even after fsync in
the no-journal mode. This also includes ext2 default mode obviously.

I've noticed this while running xfstest generic/321 and even though the
test should fail (we need to run fsck after a crash in no-journal mode)
I could not find a newly created entries even when if it was fsynced
before.

Fix this by adjusting the ext4_add_entry() successful exit paths to set
the inode EXT4_STATE_NEWENTRY so that fsync has the chance to fsync the
parent directory as well.

result the linker expects posix_memalign. This causes multiple build errors.

commit e461894dc2ce7778ccde1c3483c9b15a85a7fc5f upstream.

StrongARM core uses RCSR SMR bit to tell to bootloader that it was reset
by entering the sleep mode. After we have resumed, there is little point
in having that bit enabled. Moreover, if this bit is set before reboot,
the bootloader can become confused. Thus clear the SMR bit on resume
just before clearing the scratchpad (resume address) register.

"
other,"Introduce the 'usertemp' filesystem type

In the context of Git for Windows, the MSys2 root lives inside
%PROGRAMFILES% which is typically write-protected for mere mortals' user
accounts. In particular for /tmp/, this is a problem, because many
scripts assume that writing to /tmp/ is fair game.

MSys1 used to mount /tmp/ automatically, pointing to the current user's
temporary directory.

Let's recreate that functionality in a slightly different way: we now
interpret the filesystem type ""usertemp"" in the /etc/fstab file. To make
/tmp/ point to the temporary directory of the current user, as per the
%TMP% environment variable, just add this line to /etc/fstab:

	none /tmp usertemp binary,posix=0 0 0

Log Message: 
-----------
Fixup ASdoc for text styles and properties in TextArea/TextInput/SkinnableTextBase which are common to spark and mobile text but have different descriptions/values.  We are restricted to how we can format the doc since there can only be one @copy and it must be last.  In addition, we do not want the summary line to be ""Not supported for the mobile theme"".  Stephen Gilson and I worked out a template which uses @see rather than @copy since there can be multiple @see tags.  Look at SkinnableTextBase.editable for an example when mobile supports the property and SkinnableTextBase.typicalText for an example when mobile does not support the property.

commit 29d214576f936db627ff62afb9ef438eea18bcd2 upstream.

On Intel Panther Point chipset USB 3.0 devices show up as
high-speed devices on powerup, but after an s3 cycle they are
correctly recognized as SuperSpeed. At powerup switch the port
to xHCI so that USB 3.0 devices are correctly recognized.

other,"mm, thp: abort compaction if migration page cannot be charged to memcg

If page migration cannot charge the temporary page to the memcg,
migrate_pages() will return -ENOMEM.  This isn't considered in memory
compaction however, and the loop continues to iterate over all
pageblocks trying to isolate and migrate pages.  If a small number of
very large memcgs happen to be oom, however, these attempts will mostly
be futile leading to an enormous amout of cpu consumption due to the
page migration failures.

This patch will short circuit and fail memory compaction if
migrate_pages() returns -ENOMEM.  COMPACT_PARTIAL is returned in case
some migrations were successful so that the page allocator will retry.

Revision: 16

Log Message: 
-----------
Change 191161 by gsmith@gsmith-pc on 2007/12/15 19:30:22

	'ant clean' now cleans all build output. Besides being good build hygiene, this will prevent 'svn status' in Subversion from showing cruft.

Change 191154 by gsmith@gsmith-pc on 2007/12/15 18:29:56

	We no longer build an internal variant of fcsh.jar that had support for the old profiler.
	
	They confusingly had the same name and lived in the same directory, so building one would wipe out the other. This variant was packaged into utilities.zip, but now utilities.zip has the same fcsh.jar that is in flex_sdk_3.zip.
	
	Removed the top-level 'fcsh' target in sdk/build.xml, because fcsh.jar is now built by the 'compiler' target that builds the other compilation-related JARs.
	
	Removed the flex2.tools.Shell class used by the internal variant of fcsh.jar, and its (empty) localization files. This class would not compile (or presumably execute) without the old profiler.jar.
	
Change 191153 by gsmith@gsmith-pc on 2007/12/15 17:46:29

	Removed targets in sdk/build.xml related to the old profiler, which isn't part of Flex 3 and isn't being open-sourced.

appended to, and properly sent.

"
other,"Raise OS_TEST_TIMEOUT

Several apic_aim unit tests have been occasionally failing in the
gate, then passing when rechecked. This appears to be due to them
taking longer than 120 seconds to complete. We need to find out why
they take so long, and why the timing varies so much, but this should
help reduce the need to recheck in the mean time.

"
other,"make course copies import immediately

since course copies weren't marked as import_immediately,
there was a short window where the workflow state made the
new UI show the select content button even though the user
has already done that step.

Test Plan:
 * do a selective course copy for an at least medium sized course
 * after the progress bar appears after selecting content it should
   never revert to the select content button
 * try it a few times to verify

There is, however, a need to include ""reassemble.h"" if we're doing so,
as some of the functions we export take a ""fragment_data *"" as an
argument, and ""fragment_data"" is defined in ""reassemble.h"".

The members of ""patable"" should be set to point to functions, and
""p_prefs_register_obsolete_preference"" isn't a function -
""prefs_register_obsolete_preference"" is.

This is a small patch that makes the autopilot work much better with big heavy
airliners as well as the small Cessnas.  Of course this doesn't address the
way autopilots should be modeled.

But by making a couple changes the ""George"" is now capable of landing either a
C172 or a 747 very close to the center line of the runway with a moderate
cross breeze (15-20kt).

The changes:
- Added turn configurability so that things like Max Aileron and Roll can be
configured per aircraft.
- Enhanced localizer routine (NAV mode) to begin lining up the aircraft as soon
as the cone is entered.  The former model is adopted for the last 5km of the
approach in order to ensure greater precision (makes a very slight difference).

"
other,"Turns out I can't run this test on Python at all. The os.kill() on Windows just terminates the process, and doesn't do the Windows equivalent of a SIGINT.  If I pass it signal.CTRL_C_EVENT it *should* work on windows, but that just results in a WindowsError, so I'm at a loss.  Better to just disable it.  I didn't notice that this was causing the process to terminate since it's the last test anyways.  But this explains a lot.

"
other,"Correctly check for LegacyImplementedInBaseClass

The check I previously added in the Python IDL parser for
LegacyImplementedInBaseClass was incorrect, which I noticed on recently
comparing JSON output.
This CL fixes it; with it, Perl JSON and Python JSON are identical again.

I didn't read the original diff correctly, and there's a subtle issue of Perl
""exists/defined"" vs. True, which we need to check differently in Python.

Slimming Paint changed the behavior to clip small popups, and

of the testing.

Everything compiles again! Yey! (Don't know about working though, haven't tried
it... So be careful...)
The definitely final find_{first_}attr() functions are in place. Currently
still no support for attribute lists.
The two new _RE files contain the C-fied and more or less (more less than more
actually) cleaned up functions from the ntfs driver. Once they are cleaned
up (find_attr() is already completed but I left it in the _RE files for future
reference/educational value) and modified to suit my ideas of how they should
work, which are not quite the same as the driver way, they will make it into
attrib.[ch].
If anyone gives the new code a try, I would be interested in whether it worked
or not... (-;

For most service calls, the first element of the data.payload, data.payload[0],
of a server response provides the data object of interest.  The o1 helper
accesses this object and should be used more often.  This will decrease the
size of eg/service module.

commit 55285bf09427c5abf43ee1d54e892f352092b1f1 upstream.

Dmitry reports memleak with syskaller program.
Problem is that connector bumps skb usecount but might not invoke callback.

So move skb_get to where we invoke the callback.

We had a weird bug (crbug.com/127534) where the task was
posted and executed even after WeakPtrFactory has been deleted.
It turns out that someone was posting a task AFTER its detor was
called while executing destructor, and bots (including valgrind)
couldn't catch this because the memory stays valid until the
hosting object is deleted. This CL is to catch such case early by
resetting the ptr_.

The original pull request consisted of only commit 857a0eaaf.

Also see https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/INFRA-13719

Fixes #17224.

Some systems have more than just ""lo"" in a fresh network namespace, due
to IPv6. Instead of testing for exactly 3 lines of output (implying 1
interface), just test to make sure that the unshare call resulted in
fewer interfaces than before. This should still verify that unshare did
something.

here for do_package_write_ipk etc.)

other,"rbd: require stable pages if message data CRCs are enabled

commit bae818ee1577c27356093901a0ea48f672eda514 upstream.

rbd requires stable pages, as it performs a crc of the page data before
they are send to the OSDs.

But since kernel 3.9 (patch 1d1d1a767206fbe5d4c69493b7e6d2a8d08cc0a0
""mm: only enforce stable page writes if the backing device requires
it"") it is not assumed anymore that block devices require stable pages.

This patch sets the necessary flag to get stable pages back for rbd.

In a ceph installation that provides multiple ext4 formatted rbd
devices ""bad crc"" messages appeared regularly (ca 1 message every 1-2
minutes on every OSD that provided the data for the rbd) in the
OSD-logs before this patch. After this patch this messages are pretty
much gone (only ca 1-2 / month / OSD).

when using an external toolchain the base-files package copies libc, libgcc and

The file list is given as following in the .config:

Because the filenames are composed with different endings, not all files exist

a new file like 'uClibc'.

Adding it at the end '...resolv,util,uClibc}{-*.so,.so.*}' will lead to this
message, because the combination 'libuClibc.so.*' doesn't exist and Make will
evaluate the last copy statement of the for loop.

To fix this unwanted behaviour I added an extra 'exit 0' to each for-loop and
make ignores non-existing files as before.

commit 1200a82a59b6aa65758ccc92c3447b98c53cd7a2 upstream.

On ISOC endpoints the last trb_pool entry used as a
LINK TRB is not getting zeroed out correctly due to
memset being called incorrectly and in the wrong place.
If pool allocated from DMA was not zero-initialized
to begin with this will result in the size and ctrl
values being random garbage. Call memset correctly after
assignment of the trb_link pointer.

Note that there are no logic changes in the cursor registration.

vex: priv/main_main.c:329 (LibVEX_Translate): Assertion
`are_valid_hwcaps(VexArchAMD64, vta->archinfo_host.hwcaps)' failed.

Running with -d offers this much enlightenment:

--7732:1:main     ... arch = AMD64, hwcaps = INVALID

Not a good base for a bug report...

With this change, the user experience will be smoewhat better, e.g.:

VEX: Support for AVX2 requires AVX capabilities
     Found: amd64-cx16-rdtscp-sse3-avx2
Cannot continue. Good-bye

Specifically, the patch decouples showing hwcaps and deciding their validity.
show_hwcaps_<ARCH> reports the hwcaps it finds. It never returns NULL.
check_hwcaps checks the hwcaps for feasibility and does not return in case
VEX cannot deal with them.
The function are_valid_hwcaps no longer exists.

Move the initialization into a separate function

commit fe0a29e163a5d045c73faab682a8dac71c2f8012 upstream.

In case of capture we should not use rotation. The reverse and mask is
enough to get the data align correctly from the bus to MCU:
Format	  data from bus    after reverse (XRBUF)
S16_LE:  |LSB|MSB|xxx|xxx|  |xxx|xxx|MSB|LSB|
S24_3LE: |LSB|DAT|MSB|xxx|  |xxx|MSB|DAT|LSB|
S24_LE:  |LSB|DAT|MSB|xxx|  |xxx|MSB|DAT|LSB|
S32_LE:  |LSB|DAT|DAT|MSB|  |MSB|DAT|DAT|LSB|

With this patch all supported formats will work for playback and capture.

I updated some things, remove some PHP lines in the comment function, that I think weren't necessary (did that in the previous commit but forgot to mention it) also I renamed all the PHP?> tags to ?>. I read in the docs at http://php.net that this is the way to go. Also I renamed all <? to <?PHP. I added a BCGOLOR again, so my theme's build up is a little nicer again. Spotted four (yes 4) bugs. I now use regular HTML to assign colors but in abstract and article, the sections were still done the old way. Fixed that now, but left them black. Oh yeah, I fixed that weird rendering of my theme I think Dries was talking about. He didn't exactly mention what was wrong but I assume that it were the links in abstract and article that didn't display at the right of the story. Because I deleted some tables I had to add COLSPAN=""2"". However, when I loaded my page locally on eden it displayed correct. But when I browsed to drop it didn't (in the same browser) Do you get it? I sure don't. It was the same HTML code, but seems differently parsed when coming from an outside server. Allthough I don't see why Netscape would see apache locally as something different than another one. Nevertheless, I think it's fixed.

Jeroen.

other,"arm64: readahead: fault retry breaks mmap file read random detection

commit 569ba74a7ba69f46ce2950bf085b37fea2408385 upstream.

This is the arm64 portion of commit 45cac65b0fcd (""readahead: fault
retry breaks mmap file read random detection""), which was absent from
the initial port and has since gone unnoticed. The original commit says:

> .fault now can retry.  The retry can break state machine of .fault.  In
> filemap_fault, if page is miss, ra->mmap_miss is increased.  In the second
> try, since the page is in page cache now, ra->mmap_miss is decreased.  And
> these are done in one fault, so we can't detect random mmap file access.
>
> Add a new flag to indicate .fault is tried once.  In the second try, skip
> ra->mmap_miss decreasing.  The filemap_fault state machine is ok with it.

With this change, Mark reports that:

> Random read improves by 250%, sequential read improves by 40%, and
> random write by 400% to an eMMC device with dm crypto wrapped around it.

Date	Fri, 18 Oct 2013 13:52:27 +0200

Save the current wake up latency of a core. This latency is not always
the latency of a defined c-state but can also be an intermediate value
when a core is ready to shutdown (timer migration, cache flush ...) but
wait for the last core of the cluster to finalize the cluster power down.
This latter use case is not manage by the current version of the patch because
it implies that the cpuidle drivers set the wake up latency instead of the
cpuidle core.

other,"iwlwifi: silently ignore fw flaws in Tx path

BugLink: http://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/1102417

commit 27edb1accf5695ff00a32c85c4a00ac7e1e7f298 upstream.

We know that we have issues with the fw in the reclaim path.
This is why iwl_reclaim doesn't complain too loud when it
happens since it is recoverable. Somehow, the caller of
iwl_reclaim however WARNed when it happens. This doesn't
make any sense.

When I digged into the history of that code, I discovered
that this bug occurs only when we receive a BA notification.
So move the W/A in the BA notification handling code where
it was before.

This makes the CullSet check into an early out instead of

It also moves the |visible_| early out to the same place
from PaintCommon(). This hints at combining Paint() and
PaintCommont().

This also moves the |visible_| early out to the other caller
of PaintCommon() which is OnPaintLayer(), and can early
out before doing the solid color clear.

other,"workqueue: separate out worker_pool flags

GCWQ_MANAGE_WORKERS, GCWQ_MANAGING_WORKERS and GCWQ_HIGHPRI_PENDING
are per-pool properties.  Add worker_pool->flags and make the above
three flags per-pool flags.

The changes in this patch are mechanical and don't caues any
functional difference.  This is to prepare for multiple pools per
gcwq.

other,"x86: Make sure we can boot in the case the BDA contains pure garbage

commit 7c10093692ed2e6f318387d96b829320aa0ca64c upstream.

On non-BIOS platforms it is possible that the BIOS data area contains
garbage instead of being zeroed or something equivalent (firmware
people: we are talking of 1.5K here, so please do the sane thing.)

We need on the order of 20-30K of low memory in order to boot, which
may grow up to < 64K in the future.  We probably want to avoid the
lowest of the low memory.  At the same time, it seems extremely
unlikely that a legitimate EBDA would ever reach down to the 128K
(which would require it to be over half a megabyte in size.)  Thus,
pick 128K as the cutoff for ""this is insane, ignore.""  We may still
end up reserving a bunch of extra memory on the low megabyte, but that
is not really a major issue these days.  In the worst case we lose
512K of RAM.

This code really should be merged with trim_bios_range() in
arch/x86/kernel/setup.c, but that is a bigger patch for a later merge
window.

In init functions, whether the code of NEON initialization is compiled
is decided by macros HAS_XXXX_NEON. These macros HAS_XXXX_NEON are defined
according to __ARM_NEON__/LIBYUV_NEON/__aarch64__. For ARM32, ""-mfpu=neon""
isn't passed to the files containing init functions. So __ARM_NEON__ is
undefined which leads to NEON functions are disabled.
In this patch, LIBYUV_NEON is added to enable HAS_XXXX_NEON definition for ARM32.

The VGA plane needs to be disabled before we start doing any
modeset operations on resume.

This should also guarantee that the power well will be enabled
when we call i915_redisable_vga() since it gets explicitly powered on
during resume, and will get powered back off during the modeset
operation if no longer needed.

Change flag ""suspended"" to atomic, to fix races with multiple suspend

Also, use a different ""poweron"" flag instead of suspend, to decide how
to deal with the interrupt, since the order of setting/clearing the
suspended flag doesn't line up with the intended usage.

Currently the watermark of the device is only set based on the watermark

set on any attached in-kernel buffers.

Change this so that the watermark of the device should be the minimum of
the watermarks over all attached buffers.

The new macOS 10.12 way of loading dylib (placing them at the end of the currently
loaded segments) requires that Valgrind needs to know where the last segment was loaded.

A new structure (load_info_t) has been created to store all this information and easily
carry it around.

Changes:
- dyld text address is relative instead of absolute (macOS 10.12)
- Handle dylinker's offset (macOS 10.12)
- Handle the executable requesting a non-default stack address (macOS 10.12)
- Refactor to use load_info_t structure (all macOS)

Patch from Louis Brunner.

Current contents of tools/measuretools package:

    beam

    concentrate

    make

The function takes a binary measure of, for example, 2/8 and multiplies by a 'clever' form of 1. For example, 2/8 * 5/5 = 5/20. Or 2/8 * 3/3 = 3/12.

Example. 

   t = RigidMeasure((2, 8), construct.scale(2))
   Beam(t[:])

        WebKit2 flashes if entering and exiting compositing rapidly
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=60198

        If a page enters then immediately leaves compositing mode, the
        DrawingAreaImpl would send a message to the UI process that it
        had entered compositing even after all the layers had been torn
        down. Fix this by never sending the 'enter' message if we're
        waiting for the 'exit' timer to fire.

        Also fix an assertion in the UI process caused by sending mismatched
        'enter' and 'leave' messages by keeping track of which messages
        we've sent.

other,"First implementation of token selection in the ManualRenameInput widget:
CTRL+click on a token word in the line edit widget will mark it and
enable two buttons, to move the token around in the parse string.

Right now the movement is broken since I just changed nearly all code
before the commit (;-)), but at least the tokens can be selected.

To make this work, the main parser needs to generate a map of tokens,
where the key is a coordinate pair in the line edit widget and the value
is the replaced string. I think this is the most easy implementation, I
have not found a better solution yet. Since the line edit widget doesn't
know parsers (or at least token strings), it can not filter them
directly.
So the tokenMap seems to be the best solution.

Note: the tokenMap is not generated in BQM and therefore selecting
tokens won't work in there. I have not yet figured out why, need to
check that.

The next steps: Fix movement, maybe highlight token words (either by
mouse over or my different colors, but this is not possible with
KLineEdit).

Background: We restart adbd between runs because we noticed that the
likelyhood of an adbd hang goes up with the length of time the process
has been running.

Killing was just a convenient way to do that, but it isn't the most robust.
The chromium.perf bots are very frequently going offline now and they
always are getting stuck at the point of the adbd restart. So I'm trying
this gentler method of restarting to see if it improves reliability.

TFriendElement is never really the owner of the
TTree is points (in the common case, the TFile objects owns it).

In case where the TTree and its friend are in the same file, this
leads to a double deletion of the friend tree.

The solution is to just remove the deletion of the TTree from
the TFriendElement destructor.

The only downside is that in the case (should be rare!) where
the TFriendElement does not own the TFile and the TFriendElement
is deleted then the TTree will be kept in memory until the file
is deleted.

"
other,"DevTools: [SSP] treat new rules out of style cascade.

Currently, as a new rule gets added with ""+"" button in StylesSidebarPane,
its properties are treated as a part of a style cascade. This results
in some of them being crossed-out, and some of them overriding
properties from other styles.

However, this is almost always wrong, as it doesn't respect rule's
selector specificity.

This patch pulls new rule out of styles cascade, so its properties are
never crossed-out and it never overrides other style's properties.

functions. This patch optimizes int2_sum(), int4_sum(), float4_accum()

(e.g. SELECT sum(int2_col) FROM table where table has a single column),

with wider rows, the relative performance improvement will not be as

other,"[r=wallyworld] juju upgrade-juju - major version upgrades

Previously, juju upgrade-juju rejected major version upgardes. They are now allowed, with some other changes.

1. No version specified

If the CLI major version > agent major version, then the target version for upgrade is the CLI version. Where CLI major version = agent major version, then the minor version is bumped to the next stable release version as happens now.

2. Minor version downgrades not supported

Tools matching has already been changed to match on major.minor, and the new upgrade infrastructure only supports upgrading, so we should disallow downgrades.

Patch by Andreas Kling <kling@webkit.org> on 2011-11-16
Reviewed by Antti Koivisto.

class type instead. There's no compelling reason for CSSInheritedValue

Original issue upmerged to v2:
FTVPI-593: Workaround to support PlayReady DRM content on
Fire TV Gen1 & Fire TV Stick

[Problem]
Playready DRM encrypted content fails to play in Fire TV Gen1 & Fire TV Stick

[Root cause]
Both these devices have a limitation in the platform that the clear data
can't be passed to the PlayReady DRM stack without acquiring a valid license key.
ExoPlayer configures media codec with Codec Specific Data (CSD) in clear
before it acquires DRM license keys and so the media codec throws an
exception.

[Solution]
Wait for the license keys to be acquired before initializing the codec.

[Tests]
Tested AAC and Dolby content on Fire TV Gen1 & Fire TV Stick on
JB OS and FOS5.
Tested AAC and Dolby content on FIre TV Gen2 for regressions.
Tested WV encrypted content playabck for regressions

Both core and extensions can (and do) modify the thumbnail string
e.g. to add page numbers, languages, etc.

As bawolff notes in the commentary to bug 55963, the assumption
that the filename itself appears twice is likely to be violated
from time to time, but for the moment it suffices to fix the
apparent regression described in that bug report.

Also includes some additional test cases.

        WebSocket: WebSocketChannel::fail() should close the connection immediately
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=61851

        The effect of this change is almost unobservable. The difference between m_handle->close() and
        m_handle->disconnect() is that the former does not close the connection if the handle has
        unsent data while the latter immediately closes the connection regardless of unsent data.
        Usually a socket stream handle does not have unsent data, and even if it has any, it is hard
        for user scripts to observe the difference between close() and disconnect() (it should take some time
        for onclose() to be called if there are any unsent data, but there ought to be no other difference
        in user scripts' perspective).

        No new tests are added, because writing a test for this issue is not feasible due to the above reason.

 * all files and directory whose names start by . are skipped 
   while tranversing directories: no more visits of .svn !
 * new option -boot to be used when computing dependencies of the

    - no need in this case to records the system .vo in coqlibKnown
    - add directly inside coqdep the equivalent of -R theories Coq

As a result, coqdep'ing all the .vo of the stdlib now takes 25s

"
other,"- improvements to the VM swapping thread. It focuses on the Linux problem of
  materializing large results (rather than read-only input bats).

  I/O is now done in tiles of 128MB

  For large results, it determines the hp->free pointer (roughly) by walking
  the tiles of a mmap  backwards and saving them. If this takes time, the pages
  actually exist and this is were hp-> must be.

  After finding this out, it starts saving from there until the end (making sure
  that it never overtaking the producing operator, again by timing the writes).

  If the RSS exceeds the target, we start unloading pages from where we
  started saving (pages before are not saved, and while in memory need there
  is no time to save them).

  If we detect that the operator is done producing, we re-start unloading
  at the first save point.

  All this assumes that the produced BAT will be read out sequentially.
  Your mileage may vary. In XMark Q11,Q12 it does what it is supposed to do.

- set mem_maxsize to 81.5% of RAM size (which means that the VM thread will actually
  kick in ; now it does not because mem_maxsize ~= 100% of RAM (which is never reached)

"
other,"On a big application linking with gtk, using the compilation options
-ffunction-sections -fdata-sections and the linker option
-Wl,--gc-sections, --read-var-info=yes gives the following:

    valgrind: m_debuginfo/d3basics.c:973 (vgModuleLocal_evaluate_GX): Assertion 'aMax == ~(Addr)0' failed.

    host stacktrace:
    ==18521==    at 0x38057C54: show_sched_status_wrk (m_libcassert.c:308)
    ==18521==    by 0x38057F50: report_and_quit (m_libcassert.c:367)
    ==18521==    by 0x38058151: vgPlain_assert_fail (m_libcassert.c:432)
    ==18521==    by 0x3813F084: vgModuleLocal_evaluate_GX (d3basics.c:973)
    ==18521==    by 0x38098300: data_address_is_in_var (debuginfo.c:2769)
    ==18521==    by 0x38099E26: vgPlain_get_data_description (debuginfo.c:3298)
    ...

The problem is that -Wl,--gc-sections eliminates the unused functions
but keeps some debug info for the functions or their compilation units.
The dwarf entry has low and high pc, but both are equal to 0.
The dwarf reader of Valgrind is confused by this, as the varstack becomes
empty, while it should not. This then causes local (eliminated) variables
to be put in the global scope, leading afterwards to evaluation errors
when describing any other variables.

The fix is to also push something on the varstack when
a CU that has low and high pc given but with 0 value.
This is similar to the varstack_push done for a CU that has
no low pc, no high pc and no range.
Despite considerable effort to make a small reproducer, the problem
could only be produced with a big executable.
After the fix, everything was working properly.

The wrong behaviour for dwarf entries produce the following trace:
     <2><2ff291a>: Abbrev Number: 23 (DW_TAG_formal_parameter)
         DW_AT_name        : AET	
         DW_AT_decl_file   : 1	
         DW_AT_decl_line   : 243	
         DW_AT_type        : <2ff2811>	
         DW_AT_location    : 18288554	
      Recording this variable, with 1 PC range(s)
    ....
    <2ff291a> addVar: level 0: AET :: EdgeTableEntry*
      Loc=GX(final){[0x0,0x8]=50,[0x9,0x1d]=53,[0x1e,0x26]=51,[0x27,0x29]=53,[0x2a,0x2f]=51,[0x44,0x4a]=53,[0x4d,0x5e]=51,[0x5f,0x62]=53}
      FrB=none
      declared at: gdkpolyreg-generic.c:243
      ACQUIRE for range(s) [0x0,0xffffffff] 

The AET is a formal parameter of a function, but is wrongly added
at level 0, with a PC range covering the full space. It has a Loc GX
which uses non biased program counters (e.g. 0x0,0x8).
This dwarf entry will require a FrB (and registers when evaluating)
but no such things are available (or given) when evaluating a variable
in the global scope.

The fix is to handle compilation units with lo and hi pc == 0x0
similarly to a CU that has no lo and hi pc.
With this fix, valgrind --read-var-info=yes could properly
handle a big application with plenty of eliminated functions.

Docutils 0.10 breaks manpage generation in sphinx 1.1.3. A fix to
sphinx has been merged, but not yet released (scheduled for dec
24-31). In the mean time, we should pin docutils to 0.9.1.

Between commits 8323f26ce342 (""sched: Fix race in task_group()"") and

With both applied, all you have to do to crash a box is disable
autogroup during boot up, then reboot..  boom, NULL pointer dereference
due to commit 800d4d30c8f2 not allowing autogroup to move things, and
commit 8323f26ce342 making that the only way to switch runqueues:

"
other,"Throttle prepaints to avoid colliding with post-load work

On the page cyclers (especially intl1) the prepaint logic in the compositor
interferes with the subsequent page's load time when --force-compositing-mode
is active. This is because the prepaint schedules a commit immediately
after finishing a prepaint-eligible paint. On the page cyclers, this means that
we frequently do a second commit just after starting the load on the next page
in the set since the new page's URL is set just after the onload event.

This patch tweaks the prepaint to happen only after we perform an updateLayers()
that's prepaint eligible and then go 100ms (number picked somewhat arbitrarily)
without receiving another setNeedsCommit().  The goal is to only prepaint if
the compositor scene is roughly steady - if we're still receiving invalidations
on the main content then it's less likely that prepainting will be useful.

On pages in the wild that load quickly, the first prepaint after first paint is
likely to collide with onload and shortly-after-onload logic. Delaying until we
reach a steady state shouldn't slow down static pages but will help avoid
contention and wasted work on pages that modify the page on or shortly after
onload.

lib/http.js:
  - moved parameter validation under view() API to query.js, since we need to
    validate query parameters at several places.
  - view() API just returns the Query() instance.

lib/query.js:
  - implements the following query API.
      q.query(queryparams, callback)

  - implements the following paginator API.

"
other,"From Sven Meier (on -dev in 6/2007):

This is a dissector for the Parallel Redundancy Protocol (PRP) defined in chapter
6 of the IEC 62439.

PRP uses two independent networks in parallel and allows redundancy without
switchovers.

The protocol is sending Mac multicast messages with Ethertype 0x88fb. In
addition to that it adds to every Ethernet frame a 4 byte trailer before
the FCS. The trailer is detected by checking a size field and an identifier
which are part of the trailer. Therefore, if the last 4 bytes of a frame
match a correct trailer they get interpreted as a trailer, although it was
probably not a real one.

Note:

This is a post-dissector which means it gets called for every frame.  So as
to not cause a performance hit for every Wireshark user (who may not even be
looking at Ethernet frames) it currently disables itself every time Wireshark
starts up.  (There should be a better way to do this--maybe different Profiles
(as discussed on -dev recently) is the way to go.)

From me:

Put ETHERTYPE_PRP (not IANA registered) in etypes.h and packet-ethertype.c

  < 'example.com', userB, realmB, paths=[ '/foo/' ] >

Then a LookupByPath() for '/foo/bar/baz' should return the cache entry for userB rather than userA.

I added some extra tests to catch the case of setting a container to hold
an empty container/assigning an empty container to a container. These revealed
the old massive memory allocation bug again, so I modified the
abstract_container%set method to avoid allocations which seem to trigger it.
I.e. allocating a temporary variable containing the type passed in to the set
method that time is another container.

"
other,"sched: Improve scalability via 'CPU buddies', which withstand random perturbations

Traversing an entire package is not only expensive, it also leads to tasks
bouncing all over a partially idle and possible quite large package.  Fix
that up by assigning a 'buddy' CPU to try to motivate.  Each buddy may try
to motivate that one other CPU, if it's busy, tough, it may then try its
SMT sibling, but that's all this optimization is allowed to cost.

Sibling cache buddies are cross-wired to prevent bouncing.

4 socket 40 core + SMT Westmere box, single 30 sec tbench runs, higher is better:

To accomplish this, it subscribes the application controlling the
channel to the new bridge before adding it to that bridge which
required the stasis_app_control structure to maintain a reference to
the stasis_app.

"
other,"[Oilpan] De-oilpanize ScopedPageLoadDeferrer.

ScopedPageLoadDeferrer is an RAII-like class that does some work when it is
constructed and destructed, just like other ScopedXXX classes.

It was oilpanized in the past, and a new method, dispose(), was added to
do clean-ups that had been done in the destructor. However, a few stack-
allocated usages were overlooked in that change.

Garbage-collected objects shouldn't be allocated on the stack. So, stack-
allocated usages should be converted to heap-allocated, with dispose() calls
added in every single place where the object can go out of scope.

However, I find this conversion too cumbersome and less C++-idiomatic.

Therefore, this patch instead de-oilpanizes ScopedPageLoadDeferrer. The only
reference to will-be-heap-managed class in ScopedPageLoadDeferrer is
RefPtr<LocalFrame>, so it is safe to convert it to RefPtrWillBePersistent.

I think this patch makes the code cleaner overall.

"
other,"When passing `$full` to `get_posts_by_author_sql()`, make sure a 'post_type' clause is included in results.

This change makes the 'post_type' clause in `wp_list_authors()` redundant, so
we remove it. Third-party plugins using `get_posts_by_author_sql()` may have
similarly redundant clauses, but this won't change the results returned by the
SQL queries.

Also adds unit tests for `get_posts_by_author_sql()`.

realized that I like it.  Thanks guys!

I like it because there's no more empty gray-space to the left

distinction between the login window and the buddy list.

I also removed the version number from the about window, since
it's super-imposed on the logo.

CHANGE-SPACE-REQUIREMENTS and scrolls the pane if the cursor is not visible.

[ Upstream commit a53b72c83a4216f2eb883ed45a0cbce014b8e62d ]

The permission check in sock_diag_put_filterinfo is wrong, and it is so removed
from it's sources it is not clear why it is wrong.  Move the computation
into packet_diag_dump and pass a bool of the result into sock_diag_filterinfo.

This does not yet correct the capability check but instead simply moves it to make
it clear what is going on.

<flo@rfc822.org> for the sample traces.

It turns out that the iptrace 2.0 header is simply an extension to
the iptrace 1.0 header. It also appears that iptrace 1.0 has only tv_sec, but
not tv_usec, which explains why the fields are separated in the iptrace 2.0
header, but doesn't explain why the iptrace 2.0 header has tv_sec copied
in two places.

I changed iptrace.c to detect FDDI captures via if_type, even though I
don't have a trace to substantiate this. If *should* work, given that
loopback, ethernet, token-ring, and X.25 work. If it doesn't work, someone
will let me know.

other,"rcu: Yield simpler

The rcu_yield() code is amazing. It's there to avoid starvation of the
system when lots of (boosting) work is to be done.

Now looking at the code it's functionality is:

 Make the thread SCHED_OTHER and very nice, i.e. get it out of the way
 Arm a timer with 2 ticks
 schedule()

Now if the system goes idle the rcu task returns, regains SCHED_FIFO
and plugs on. If the systems stays busy the timer fires and wakes a
per node kthread which in turn makes the per cpu thread SCHED_FIFO and
brings it back on the cpu. For the boosting thread the ""make it FIFO""
bit is missing and it just runs some magic boost checks. Now this is a
lot of code with extra threads and complexity.

It's way simpler to let the tasks when they detect overload schedule
away for 2 ticks and defer the normal wakeup as long as they are in
yielded state and the cpu is not idle.

That solves the same problem and the only difference is that when the
cpu goes idle it's not guaranteed that the thread returns right away,
but it won't be longer out than two ticks, so no harm is done. If
that's an issue than it is way simpler just to wake the task from
idle as RCU has callbacks there anyway.

Unlike adding or removing lumps, adding or removing misc_models will change the indices of any following bodies such as func_trains. To allow for future changes to the model configuration while preventing replay breakage, this commit moves those entities ""out of the way"". (At this time, this is only done for maps where 1.5.4 compatibility has already been broken.)

"
other,"Make dropping remote content onto Plasma work

The idea is that you drop a file from a webpage, or basically a URL onto Plasma and Plasma creates a suitable applet to display this URL. For example an image frame for picture, or a previewer for pdf files. Downloading the data itself (and possibly saving it) is left to the applets. The mimetype needs to be retrieved as it cannot be determined from the URL.

The code pathes I've changed or added are, roughly:
- ""something"" is dropped onto Plasma
- if it's a remote URL, we don't know the mimetype of the object behind the URL yet
- a KIO::TransferJob is used to retrieve the mimetype asynchronously, and will call back
- we open a QMenu that says ""Fetching file type...""
- If the user closes the menu while the mimetype is being retrieved, we will open a new one
- When the TransferJob calls back, and we have our mimetype, we offer a list of applets suitable for this kind of content
- If the user chooses to create an applet, we put the transfer job on hold to make it available for recycling by the applet
- If the user dismisses the offering, we kill the job

Thanks to marco for reviewing and everybody else for the input :)

Next steps are making some more applets work with this.

Commit f1d669aee994b28e1afcfe974680565932d25b70 added support for
AES_256_GCM_SHA384 cipher suites as specified in RFC5289. However, it
did not take the arbitrary hash function into account in the TLS client
handshake when using client certificates.

The hashForClientCertificate method always returned SHA256 as its
hashing function, even if it actually used a different one to calculate
its digest. Setting up the connection would eventually fail with the
error ""tls: failed to sign handshake with client certificate:
crypto/rsa: input must be hashed message"".

Included is an additional test for this specific situation that uses the

"
other,"Split CustomElementRegistry into a registration context and a registry.

The CustomElementRegistry is now only responsible for: 1. processing
Custom Element registrations; 2. looking up a definition from the set
of registered definitions.

The new class is called CustomElementRegistrationContext.

Internally, CustomElementRegistrationContext is a controller,
coordinating the registry and upgrade candidates map, and sending a
stream of callbacks to the callback dispatcher to implement instance
lifecycle.

Externally, CustomElementRegistrationContext is a facade to the rest
of the Custom Elements machinery. With one exception* the rest of core
uses the registration context to process custom elements.

The goal of this refactoring is to create a registration context which
can be shared by multiple documents (so they can share definitions)
and make it possible to identify when an element is being adopted into
a different registration context (so the element's lifecycle can be
reset; exact details TBD.)

There is no sharing yet, but as a first step, this creates a
document's registration context eagerly. In a follow-up change a
shared registration context will be handed to related documents. Lazy
shared registration context creation can be investigated later if it
is warranted for performance.

* Microtask tickles the CustomElementCallbackDispatcher to perform a
  checkpoint. This is probably going away soon.

	From 2000-10-19  Steven Johnson  <sbjohnson@ozemail.com.au>
        Note: The original patch used asprintf/vasprintf.  I changed it to
	use the new xasprintf/xvasprintf gdb functions.
        * gdbtk.c (TclDebug, gdbtk_init): Replaced the vast majority of
	sprintf/vsprintf calls with asprintf and vasprintf respectively.
	Should prevent any possible buffer overruns possible with
	fixed size sprintf buffers. Specifically fixes a problem with long
	filenames and clearing breakpoints overflowing their buffers when
	using sprintf, causing a segfault. Generically should also prevent
	any other similar problems from occuring.
        * gdbtk-cmds.c (sprintf_append_element_to_obj, get_pc_register,
	gdb_get_tracepoint_info, gdb_load_disassembly, gdbtk_load_source,
	gdbtk_load_asm, gdb_set_bp, gdb_set_bp_addr, gdb_get_breakpoint_info,
	gdb_selected_frame, gdb_selected_block, gdb_get_blocks): Ditto.
        * gdbtk-hooks.c (gdbtk_warning, gdbtk_ignorable_warning,
	gdbtk_readline_begin, gdbtk_set_hook, breakpoint_notify,
	gdbtk_query, tracepoint_notify, gdbtk_error_begin,

        - fixed 3161953 -- crash in KWQListImpl, DOM::CSSStyleSheetImpl::isLoading on XML page

        The problem is that this page has some non-HTML elements, but the code was checking

other,"Ensure that flash fullscreen mode works in Chrome desktop AURA.

Currently fullscreen flash only works in Chrome ASH.

When fullscreen mode is requested by a plugin (flash) a new RenderWidgetHostViewAura
instance is created and its RenderWidgetHostViewAura::InitAsFullscreen method is invoked.

In Chrome ASH on Windows 8 and Chrome OS we find a root window with matching bounds as
those passed in and also eventually resize the aura::Window instance maintained by the
RenderWidgetHostViewAura created above after reparenting it to the RootWindow found above.

In desktop Chrome we create a top level fullscreen widget and set it as the parent of the
aura::Window instance hosted by the RenderWidgetHostViewAura class.

The code to create a temporary top level fullscreen widget is provided by a new class
DesktopNativeWidgetFullscreenHandler which is created as a singleton. This class watches the
RenderWidgetHostViewAura window and when it is destroyed destroys the top level fullscreen widget.

I also fixed the DCHECK which was occurring in the RenderWidgetHostViewAura::TransientWindowObserver
class on Windows due to setting an observer on an aura::Window instance which was already
setup in the contructor of this class. The DCHECK fires because of attempting to add the 
same observer twice.

other,"Port all module map and header parsing related flags to the new crosstool
configuration.

Together with [] (change to the crosstool configuration), the
resulting blaze is able to build header modules (minus clang bugs).

Detailed changes:
1. Adapt CppCompileAction to only insert the arguments itself if the crosstool
   does not specify a feature.
2. Make CppCompileAction provide the build variables to the flag expansion.
3. Pass package features through to the new feature selection / crosstool
   configuration; allow rules to always request features and mark features
   as unsupported.
4. Add feature ""header_module_includes_dependencies"" that controls whether we
   can only provide top-level header modules in the ${module_files} build
   variable; the currently integrated clang does not fully support that yet.
5. Add feature ""use_header_modules"", which allows targets to use compiled
   header modules without being compilable as module themselves.
6. Convert tests to use the feature configuration where it makes sense; we will
   be able to delete a lot of unit tests once the control via the feature
   configuration is rolled out to the stable crosstool, and implement them
   as crosstool integration tests.

Rather than accessing it through pinfo->pseudo_header, have it passed as

This means we no longer tweak the pseudo-header filled in by libwiretap,
but instead construct our own pseudo-header, which is a bit cleaner.

It also opens up the possibility of other dissectors passing radio
information down to the 802.11 dissector, so it can display it in a
better-organized format than the raw metadata headers for
radiotap/PPI/Prism/AVS/etc., and having some of the options for 802.11
dissection (Atheros padding, Centrino stuff, etc.) also passed in
through that pseudo-header so we have fewer arguments to
dissect_ieee80211_common().

"
other,"major rewrite of the spider.

Original commit message from CVS:
major rewrite of the spider.
Now uses GstSpiderConnection to track current connections and remember the way they're plugged.
Advantages of this approach:
- function prototypes are now much cleaner.
- Allow event propagation (EOS) to elements that are not connected but plugged.
- Allow deconstruction of plugged pipes. (not implemented)
Disadvantage:
- I screwed up naming (always get src and sink the wrong way). It's very inconsistent in the gstspider.[ch] files
- a little more time and memory are needed to manage the structs

other,"Isolate GYP target and .isolate files for tests

Implemented according to the instructions at
http://www.chromium.org/developers/testing/isolated-testing

Workflow has been like this:
1. create _run GYP target
2. create a stripped down .isolate file
3. export GYP_DEFINES=""$GYP_DEFINES test_isolation_mode=check""
4. runhooks
5. compile
6. test if the test would run (i.e. find it's dependencies) without
   actually executing it:
   tools/swarm_client/isolate.py run --isolated out/Release/testname.isolated
7. If failing, run the fix_test_cases.py script like this:
   tools/swarm_client/fix_test_cases.py --isolated out/Release/testname.isolated

All tests that run on the bots for WebRTC has got _run target
and .isolate file created.

""Normal tests"" that run fine on any machine:
* audio_decoder_unittests
* common_audio_unittests
* common_video_unittests
* metrics_unittests
* modules_integrationtests
* modules_unittests
* neteq_unittests
* system_wrappers_unittests
* test_support_unittests
* tools_unittests
* video_engine_core_unittests
* voice_engine_unittests

Tests that requires bare-metal and audio/video devices:
* audio_device_integrationtests
* video_capture_integrationtests

I also added the isolate boilerplate code for the following
tests that are not yet pure gtest binaries (which means they
cannot run isolated yet):
* video_render_integrationtests
* vie_auto_test
* voe_auto_test

TEST=running isolate.py as described above.

        Fixed <rdar://problem/5241167> REGRESSION: PLT 1% slower due to r21793 
        (global page cache cap)
        
        I just measured a .1%-.2% regression in PLT average, but a .4% win in 
        PLT fastest run, so I think this regression is licked.

        Surprisingly, the combination of wtf data structures I originally used 
        for PageCache turned out to be too slow, so I reworked PageCache to use
        a hand-crafted linked list for LRU tracking (instead of ListHashSet), 
        to store its CachedPages in the HistoryItems to which they corresponded 
        (instead of using a HashMap), and to ref/deref HistoryItems manually
        (instead of using RefPtr, which would ref once for every reference in 
        the linked list).

        * history/HistoryItem.h: Added data members for PageCache data. Made
        PageCache a friend so it could access them. Ideally (from an 
        encapsulation perspective), we would store this data an independent 
        structure, but that's just too slow.

        * history/PageCache.cpp: Added a hand-crafted linked list for LRU 
        tracking.
        (WebCore::PageCache::PageCache):
        (WebCore::PageCache::add): Adopt the HistoryItem's ref when it's added.
        (WebCore::PageCache::remove): deref() the Historyitem when it's 
        removed.
        (WebCore::PageCache::prune):
        (WebCore::PageCache::addToLRUList):
        (WebCore::PageCache::removeFromLRUList):

        * history/PageCache.h:
        (WebCore::PageCache::get): Inlined just in case.

	must be handle by Theme, now it call DataGridPaintColumnHeader.

	* DataGridTextBoxColumn.cs: Fix the textbox size. It must be one pixel less,
	test cases must be also fixed because it checks for wrong size.

	* ThemeWin32Classic.cs: 
		- Draw the bottom line of grid caption.
		- Prevent to draw caption text when it is empty.
		- Use CPDrawBorder3D for 3D efects to simplify code.
		- Uses 3D (when not flat) to paint corner shared between row and column
		header.
		- Fix header drawing issues on win32, now borders are drawing.
		- Fix column header paint issues to mimic win32.
		- Adjust header drawing for last column, like first one it must be draw
		different.
		- Added DataGridPaintRowHeaderStar to draw star like .net does, it is
		not an character.
		- DataGridPaintColumnHeader created to draw column headers, it also
		paint stuff right on Win32.
		- Use DataGridPaintColumnHeader method instead of DataGridColumnStyle 
		class.

	* Theme.cs: 
		- DataGridPaintRowHeaderStar method added.
		- DataGridPaintColumnHeader method added.

other,"Now that we do not need the new object while holding the highly trafficed
objhead lock, don't preallocate objects.

One unfortunate effect of this preallocation, only recently identified:

On systems with high number of worker threads and high hitrates, considerable
time could elapse between the preallocation of an object to a worker
thread and the use of that object.

This could make cache-misses use a much larger working set size than
really necessary.

I do not have access to any benchmarks that show a credible performance
difference, but reports are most welcome.

"
other,"[feature] XQueryURLRewrite has been extended and may now serve as a single entry point into the web application. This makes it possible to have multiple root paths, which are either mapped to some path on the file system or a collection within the database. For example, the main web application could be served from a database collection, while URL paths starting with /fs point into the /webapp directory on the file system.

The controller.xql files, which define how a request to a certain path is handled, are now much more portable. With a properly written controller.xql, it should be possible to move an entire XQuery application from one directory to another or even from a directory into the database without changing any links or paths.

CL makes sure that all CookieMosnter tasks that can affect each other

It should have a minimal impact on performance - tasks that affect all

[It broke: http://build.chromium.org/p/chromium.chromiumos/builders/Linux%20ChromiumOS%20%28Clang%20dbg%29/builds/9217
./chrome/browser/chromeos/dbus/bluetooth_property.h:76:5: error: use of undeclared identifier 'AppendToWriter'

    ^
    this->
chrome/browser/chromeos/bluetooth/bluetooth_adapter.cc:151:44: note: in instantiation of member function 'chromeos::BluetoothProperty<bool>::Set' requested here
]

Replace the Chrome Bluetooth interface with a completely new API. Compared
to the previous code, this gives us a much cleaner interface for the
functionality we need and completely hides that there is BlueZ and D-Bus
underneath.

BluetoothManager is replaced by BluetoothAdapter::CreateDefaultAdapter(),
the adapter code itself is responsible for tracking the default adapter
removing the need for the singleton object that persists for the Chrome
lifetime. It's perfectly acceptable to have multiple instances of
BluetoothAdapter for one device as they share the same Bluetooth*Client
instances and dbus::ObjectProxy instances.

Neither BluetoothAdapter or BluetoothDevice rely on arbitrary ""unique ids""
that were really D-Bus object paths. An owner of a BluetoothAdapter instance
may simply store and use the instance; for BluetoothDevice one just uses
the address() property to identify it.

BluetoothDevice now provides some functionality that was previously
implemented in JavaScript, such as setting the name of devices before
the real name or alias is available, and determining whether or not the
device is supported. This allows us to use in multiple places in the UI.

Support for devices that are not paired, but are connected or have been
connected without being paired in the past is implemented. This may be
used for mice, and other devices where pairing is not usual.

UI Options Handler code has been updated to use the new interfaces,
support for handling USB adapter removal and insertion, control of the
adapter radio power, and populating the list of known devices has been
added.

Factor a PageLoadHistograms class out of RenderView.

No functional changes are intended.

This is in anticipation of using the new WebPerformance API:
http://trac.webkit.org/changeset/68141

My strategy is this:
1. In this patch, make the most minimal change possible to the Dump() method
   necessary to factor it out to a new class.
2. Add a new, temporary histograms which log the WebPerformance metrics which
   have an existing counterparts.
3. Once we understand any differences and are happy with the new metrics, rip
   out the old ones. This will allow more cleanup in RenderView and
   NavigationState.
4. Add new histograms for any interesting WebPerformance metrics which weren't
   previously available.

This CL turns nativeConfiguration into createNativeConfiguration returning a
pointer or nil on failure. This method's certificate generation is updated to
use the new API and reports failure (nil) if unsuccessful instead of relying on
the default certificate. We also remove the implicit assumption (now incorrect)
that RSA is the default. This is the same type of changes as was done in
https://codereview.webrtc.org/1965313002 but this file
(RTCPeerConnectionInterface.mm) was forgotten.

With no more usages of kIdentityName it and dtlsidentitystore.cc is removed.
Also removes unnecessary #include in peerconnectioninterface.h that was still
remnant due to an indirect include of kIdentityName.

RTCConfiguration+Private.h now lists method nativeEncryptionKeyTypeForKeyType
which was added in the above mentioned prior CL.

other,"cifs: don't use vfsmount to pin superblock for oplock breaks

Filesystems aren't really supposed to do anything with a vfsmount. It's
considered a layering violation since vfsmounts are entirely managed at
the VFS layer.

CIFS currently keeps an active reference to a vfsmount in order to
prevent the superblock vanishing before an oplock break has completed.
What we really want to do instead is to keep sb->s_active high until the
oplock break has completed. This patch borrows the scheme that NFS uses
for handling sillyrenames.

An atomic_t is added to the cifs_sb_info. When it transitions from 0 to
1, an extra reference to the superblock is taken (by bumping the
s_active value). When it transitions from 1 to 0, that reference is
dropped and a the superblock teardown may proceed if there are no more
references to it.

Also, the vfsmount pointer is removed from cifsFileInfo and from
cifs_new_fileinfo, and some bogus forward declarations are removed from
cifsfs.h.

machine-independent TurboChannel bus configuration.  These files
deal with stuff like:

        (2) looking at TC slots configuring any devices found.
The lists of slots, slot locations, etc. and built-in devices
are provided by machine-dependent code.  Interrupt handling
is also provided by machine-dependent code, but the MD code provides
hooks so that standard names for 'establish' and 'disestablish'
can be used in drivers.

This code requires <machine/tc_machdep.h>, which defines some
portability types specific to the TurboChannel bus code.

operator==() is also unused, so I killed it as well.

We use the same mechanism for re-initiating the navigation we use to transfer downloads over to the host, so I moved the common code to utils.cc and added NavigateBrowserToMoniker.

When we see a browser instance attempting to load a CF document, we raise a TLS flag that we catch in  HttpNegotiatePatch::ReportProgress when the mime type is being reported.  This is the same place where we examine http headers and report the mime type.

BUG=n/a
TEST=Set PatchProtocols (REG_DWORD) to 0 in the CF HKCU config key and make sure we detect and handle the meta tag as well or better than before.

Make the Diameter and iSCSI dissectors register obsolete preferences.

Crash if some code tries to register a preferences module with a name
that contains something other than lower-case ASCII letters, numbers, or
underscores, or that has already been registered, or if some code tries
to register a preference with a name that contains something other than
lower-case ASCII letters, numbers, underscores, or periods, or that has
already been registered, so that we don't put code like that in a
release and have to shovel code into ""prefs.c"" to fix it up later.  (The
problem with multiple modules or preferences with the same name should
be obvious; the problem with names with blanks, or upper-case letters,
or punctuation, is that they're a pain to type on the command line.)

return clauses: the for expression now passes the current context document set to the bound
variable, so path expressions accessing the variable can use this information to get a hint
about the total set of documents to expect. This information is used by class LocationStep to
pre-load matching element nodes - not only for the current document, but for all documents
that might be required for subsequent iterations.

other,"Revert 110505 - Report ERR_CONTENT_LENGTH_MISMATCH when the count of bytes received doesn't match Content-Length.

This used to be reported as ERR_CONNECTION_CLOSED. Unfortunately, there are a number of misconfigured servers on the web which report a Content-Length completely divorced from reality. Other browsers display whatever data was received without reporting errors in this case, and Chrome now does the same.

An earlier CL simply removed error reporting for this case. However, some uses may want to still treat this like an error (such as URLFetcher), or could eventually treat the case as an error and recover (such as downloads).

Data received will be populated in the disk cache as a truncated entry, if the server advertises byte range support.

WebURLLoaderImpl ignores this for all async and sync resource loads. At some point it may want to selectively do this based on content type.

Downloads ignore the error, but no longer ignore ERR_CONNECTION_CLOSED.

Other uses will treat this like an error.

BUG=52847
TEST=Manually, go to a site that advertises a large content-length and closes the connection before writing so many bytes, and notice that the page now displays.

While not needed in normal runtime pbx operation, it is needed when
raw exprs are being syntax checked. This plays into future syntax-
unification plans. By permission of atis, this addition in trunk 
and the reason of why things are as they are will suffice to close
this bug.

Traditionally, we've tracked the parent/child relationships between
clk structures by setting the child's parent member to point at the
upstream clock.  As a result, when decending the tree, we have had
to scan all clocks to find the children.

Avoid this wasteful scanning by keeping a list of the clock's children.

        Rename m_parser, htmlParser() to m_treeConstructor, htmlTreeConstructor() in preparation for renaming HTMLParser
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=40514

        This rename was done by hand.  I realize now I should have
        renamed HTMLParser to HTMLTreeConstructor before renaming HTMLTokenizer.

        No functional changes, thus no tests.

other,"Move Length classes to platform and break core dependencies.

The classes related to Lengths are moved from core/platform and
core/css to platform.

The dependency on CSS was due to ViewportPercentage units needed by
LengthFunctions, and is broken by moving the floatValueForLength method
into platform while leaving the other methods from LengthFunctions.h in
a new file named CSSLengthFunctions. To resolve the abiguity between the
CSS and platform versions of floatValueForLength, the RenderView argument
is made compulsory on the CSS version.

Numerous files needed to be updated. Those that only use
floatValueForLength with no RenderView get the platform version,
while the others get the CSS version with a null RenderView if
necessary. Note that a null RenderView is legal - the previous code
supported it and the default value for the RenderView parameter was
null.

better - the plugin receives already configured Aether's
org.eclipse.aether.RepositorySystem object which is then passed to
AetherBasedResolved in fabric-maven classes. This is the right approach,

This replaces the current time based approach (chrome is given N seconds
to upload all renederer histograms) with an asynch callback approach
that waits until all renderers have responded (with their updates). It
uses a fall-back timer to ensure that a hung renderer won't delay things
forever as well.

This causes faster (and complete) updates in about:histograms as well
as generally assuring complete updates during UMA gatherings.

other,"cogl-pipeline-layer: Use CoglTextureType instead of GL target enum

Instead of storing the GLenum for the target of the last used texture
for a layer it now stores the CoglTextureType instead. The state name
has been renamed to 'texture type' instead of 'texture target'.
Previously the default pipeline layer would store 0 here to represent
that there is no texture. This has been changed to store
COGL_TEXTURE_TYPE_2D instead which means that all pipeline layers
always have a valid value for the texture type. Any places that were
previously fetching the texture from a layer to determine the target
(for example when generating shaders or when enabling a particular
texture target) now use the texture type instead. This means they will
work even for layers that don't have a texture.

This also changes it so that when binding a fallback texture instead
of always using a 2D texture it will now use the default texture
corresponding to the texture type of the layer. That way when the
generated shader tries to do a texture lookup for that type of texture
it will get a valid texture object. To make this work the patch adds a
default texture for 3D textures to the context and also makes the
default rectangle texture actually be a rectangle texture instead of
using a 2D texture.

	- fixed 3017152 -- intra-page anchors not updating page address field

        * WebView.subproj/WebLocationChangeDelegate.h: Rearrange methods so they are
	in the order they are delivered. Add locationChangedWithinPageForDataSource method.
	Renamed the redirect methods to match the verb tenses used in the others.
	Removed the URL parameter from the server redirect method.
        * WebView.subproj/WebLocationChangeDelegate.m: Update the class to match the
	changes to the protocol.

        * WebCoreSupport.subproj/WebBridge.m:
        (-[WebBridge reportClientRedirectTo:delay:fireDate:]):
	Update for change to clientWillRedirectTo method name.
        (-[WebBridge loadURL:]): Call locationChangedWithinPageForDataSource:.

        * WebView.subproj/WebDataSourcePrivate.m: (-[WebDataSource _setRequest:]):
	Update for change to serverRedirectedForDataSource method name.

        * WebView.subproj/WebHTMLView.m: (-[WebHTMLView mouseMovedNotification:]):
	Remove overzealous assert that was firing for me.

        * WebCoreSupport.subproj/WebSubresourceClient.m: Update comment.
        * WebView.subproj/WebDataSource.h: Fix comment.

WebBrowser:

	WebBrowser changes to handle location changes within a page (clicks on anchors).

        * BrowserWindowController.h: Added mainFrameLocationChangedWithinPage.
        * BrowserWindowController.m:
        (-[BrowserWindowController mainFrameLocationChangedWithinPage]):
	Calls setLocationFieldTextToCurrentURL.
        * LocationChangeHandler.m:
        (-[LocationChangeHandler serverRedirectedForDataSource:]): Updated name to
	track change in WebKit. Also removed unnecessary calls to titleChangedForFrame
	and to _currentURLHasChanged, since both are only needed if the data source
	is committed, and server redirects always come before it is committed.
        (-[LocationChangeHandler locationChangedWithinPageForDataSource:]): Added.
	Has much of what used to be in serverRedirectedForDataSource, and also calls
	the new mainFrameLocationChangedWithinPage.
        (-[LocationChangeHandler clientWillRedirectTo:delay:fireDate:forFrame:]):
	Updated name to track change in WebKit.

other,"Oilpan: Prepare to move SQLResultSet and SQLResultSetRowList to oilpan heap.

Without this CL, a SQLResultSet object in SQLStatementBackend can be constructed
in a database thread, moved to main/worker thread, and referred by JavaScript
object in the main/worker thread.

We can't move object ownership over threads in Oilpan. So, SQLStatementBackend
should construct a SQLResultSet object in the SQLStatementBackend constructor,
which runs in main/worker thread. SQLResultSet should have a validity flag to
represent nullness in the code without this CL.

Note:
* Change the return type of AbstractSQLStatementBackend::sqlResultSet from
  PassRefPtr<SQLResultSet> to SQLResultSet* because the function doesn't release
  the ownership of the SQLResultSet object.

* Change the order of data members of SQLResultSet to pack better.

"
other,"Cleans up notifications for the NavigationController. There were several
notifications before and some of them were very unclear and misused
(STATE_CHANGED). This one, and PRUNED were called unnecessarily in some cases
as well.

I replaced STATE_CHANGED and INDEX_CHANGED with ENTRY_COMMITTED which is more
clear and covers (I think!) all the cases that the callers care about.

I added a simple notification testing helper class, and used in the navigation
controller unit tests to make sure we get the proper notifications. I had to
change NotificationSource/Details to have a = and copy constructor so I can
track them easily in my helper. I don't see why this would be bad.

As part of this, I got very frustrated recompiling the world whenever
navigation_types.h changed. So I removed this dependency from the notification
service which everybody includes. Most of the changed files are adding
notification_types.h in the .cc file where it's needed.

For one-time automatic bubble there are two states. One is while the bubble is visible (e.g. CONFIRMATION_STATE). The second one is after it was closed (e.g. MANAGE_STATE).

other,"Implement io.write for arbitrary streams.  With type specialization

Estimated hours taken: 25
Branches: main

Implement io.write for arbitrary streams.  With type specialization
this is only slightly slower than the original.

library/stream.string_writer.m:
library/library.m:
	A module containing predicates for writing to streams
	which accept strings.

library/stream.m:
	Move stream.format to stream.string_writer.m.

	Add stream.put_list, which is like io.write_list.

library/io.m:
	Move io.write and io.print to stream.string_writer.m.

library/term_io.m:
	Add stream versions of predicates used by io.write.

library/ops.m:
	Move io.adjust_priority_for_assoc to here (private
	predicate used only by library modules).

	Export ops.mercury_max_priority for use by
	stream.string_writer.write.

Mmake.common.in:
compiler/modules.m:
compiler/mlds.m:
compiler/mlds_to_c.m:
compiler/mlds_to_java.m:
compiler/mlds_to_managed.m:
compiler/prog_util.m:
compiler/format_call.m:
mdbcomp/prim_data.m:
	Allow sub-modules in the standard library.

compiler/polymorphism.m:
	Fix a bug which caused tests/hard_coded/print_stream.m to
	fail with this change.  The wrong argument type_info would
	be extracted from a typeclass_info if the constraints of the
	typeclass-info were not all variables.

browser/browse.m:
tests/hard_coded/stream_format.m:
tests/hard_coded/test_injection.m:
tests/invalid/string_format_bad.m:
tests/invalid/string_format_unknown.m:
	Updated for predicates moved between library modules.

util/mdemangle.c:
	The demangler doesn't properly handle the arguments MR_DECL_LL*
	and various other recently added macros for type specialized
	procedures.  It's still broken (it doesn't handle mode and label
	suffixes properly), but the output is at least more readable.

This process also involved a large amount of rework regarding how to redial
the Parker when a channel leaves a parking lot due to timeout. An attended
transfer channel variable has been added to attended transfers to extensions
that will eventually park (but haven't at the time of transfer) as well.
This resolves one of the two BUGBUG comments remaining in res_parking.

other,"Rename sub window video window.

It was a bad idea to name the video window ""sub window"" at the time
the GUI was written. The term ""sub window"" does make sense from the
programmer's point of view, but it doesn't make any sense at all from
the user's point of view, because the sub window simply is the window
where the video will be displayed.

Moreover, since the term ""sub"" is generally short for ""subtitles"",
the renaming makes the code much easier to understand.

        IndexedDB depends on DOMStringList.

        It's currently specced here:

        Existing tests cover the constructor.  IndexedDB will also use this

        Add Worker support for FileSystem API
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=45808

        Exposed requestFileSystem and Flags constructor on worker contexts.

        Also changed how to get the base path for Web file systems (in
        non-chromium ports) so that it works for workers too.
        This patch assumes each port calls
        LocalFileSystem::initializeLocalFileSystem() in its initialization
        phase.

        No new tests; tests will be added when we have complete implementation.

"
other,"cmd/compile/internal/gc: unexport more helper functions

After the removal of the old backend many types are no longer referenced
outside internal/gc. Make these functions private so that tools like
honnef.co/go/unused can spot when they become dead code. In doing so
this CL identified several previously public helpers which are no longer
used, so removes them.

This should be the last of the public functions.

"
other,"Move CSSValue and subclasses to the oilpan heap (using transition types).

This change moves the CSSValue and subclasses to the oilpan heap when the enable_oilpan flag is set. When not set there should be no impact.
It also adds the necessary trace/traceAfterDispatch methods needed to trace through the hierarchy. The methods don't do much at this point.
Once subclasses are moved entirely into using transitional types they will be added to the trace methods.
NOTE: the reason for some of the traceAfterDispatch methods to be in the .cpp files are that they will be non-trivial in the near future.

The other option would have been to place them near the Epoch. - Dates before the Common Era should now be handled as well. Earlier this wasn't the case. - Changed build settings so that libpcre from RegexKit is linked. - Wrote some tests. We need some more, though."
